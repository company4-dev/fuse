# Make Form
Creates a form class for use in Livewire

This will create a base migration within `Platforms/{Platform}/app/View/Forms/{form}.php` where `{Platform}` is your selected Platform and `{form}` is the name of form.

## Example
| Platform | Form | Class
| - | - | -
| OpsFM | AddLocation | `Platforms/OpsFM/app/View/Forms/AddLocation.php`
