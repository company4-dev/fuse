# Make Model
<!-- To create a FluxUI compatible table follow the prompts via `php artisan jb`.

This will create a base file within `Platforms/{Platform}/app/Views/Tables/{PluralTable}.php` where `{Platform}` is your selected Platform and `{PluralTable}` is the plural of the `Table` you specified.

Update the file as needed, then include it via: `<livewire:table table="{platform-slug}.{plural-table}" />` where `{platform-slug}` is the slug is the lower-case version your selected Platform and `{plural-table}` is the lower-case plural of the `Table` you specified.

## Example
| Platform | Table | Class | Include
| - | - | - | -
| OpsFM | locations | Platforms/OpsFM/app/Views/Tables/Locations.php | `<livewire:table table="opsfm.locations" />` -->
