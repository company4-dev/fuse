# Pages
Pages can be made by following the *Make Page* prompts in the `php artisan jb` command menu.

> Note: When naming the component, make sure to include the feature with a slash. E.g. `locations/add`, this helps with grouping and all other mappings (Including CSS, JS, routes).

These pages utilise Livewire Volt and don't need to be mapped via routes as they should follow a consistent structure.

## Page Elements
1. Form ([See Form Component](https://bitbucket.org/jellyhaus/jellybean/src/main/documentation/Components/Form.md))
2. [Mount](https://bitbucket.org/jellyhaus/jellybean/src/main/documentation/Pages/Mount.md)
